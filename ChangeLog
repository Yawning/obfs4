Changes in version 0.0.5 - UNRELEASED:
 - Go vet/fmt fixes, and misc. code cleanups.  Patches by mvdan.
 - Changed the go.net import path to the new location (golang.org/x/net).
 - Added limited support for detecting if the parent process crashes.
 - Support for tor feature #15335 (stdin based termination notification).

Changes in version 0.0.4 - 2015-02-17
 - Improve the runtime performance of the obfs4 handshake tests.
 - Changed the go.crypto import path to the new location (golang.org/x/crypto).

Changes in version 0.0.3 - 2014-10-01
 - Change the obfs4 bridge line format to use a "cert" argument instead of the
   previous "node-id" and "public-key" arguments.  The "cert" consists of the
   Base64 encoded concatenation of the node ID and public key, with the
   trailing padding removed.  Old style separated bridge lines are still valid,
   but the newer representation is slightly more compact.

Changes in version 0.0.2 - 2014-09-26
 - Write an example client bridge line suitable for use with the running obfs4
   server instance to "obfs4_bridgeline.txt" for the convenience of bridge
   operators.
 - Add a man page for obfs4proxy.

Changes in version 0.0.1 - 2014-09-03
